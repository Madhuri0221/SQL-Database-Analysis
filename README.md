# SQL-Database-Analysis
## Goal 
To demonstrate SQL proficiency by designing, querying, and analyzing relational databases using real-world business scenarios and the Sakila sample database.

## Description
This project contains a comprehensive set of SQL queries and explanations covering database design, constraints, normalization, joins, window functions, and advanced data analysis. The assignment includes table creation with constraints, data integrity enforcement, normalization to 1NF/2NF/3NF, and a wide range of queries for data retrieval, aggregation, and reporting. The queries are written for MySQL and are well-commented for learning and reference.

## Skills
- Writing complex SELECT queries
- Joins (INNER, LEFT, advanced joins)
- Aggregation and grouping
- Window functions and CTEs (Common Table Expressions)
- Data analysis and reporting

## Technologies
- SQL (MySQL dialect)
- Sakila sample database
- Relational database concepts
  
## Results
- Extracted actionable business insights through complex joins, aggregations, and window functions.
- Implemented CTEs and recursive queries for modular and optimized analysis.
- Strengthened expertise in SQL analytics applicable to real-world database and reporting scenarios.
